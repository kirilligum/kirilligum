## Project Summary

Synth Dev is a project focused on improving Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to understand developer documentation. It achieves this by generating a large dataset of diversified use case coding examples.

### Key Features:

*   **Dataset Generation:** Creates hundreds of coding examples to help LLMs learn from documentation.
*   **Use Cases:** Focuses on generating examples for pre-training and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
*   **Tools Used:** Employs Restack for pipeline management, TogetherAI for LLM API, Llama models, and LlamaIndex for prototyping and RAG.
