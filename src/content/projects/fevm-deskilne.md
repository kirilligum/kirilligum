## Project Summary

Sw/.tch is a decentralized professional network designed for engineers and builders. It aims to provide users with more control over their professional data and connections, moving away from traditional centralized platforms.

### Key Features:

*   **Decentralized Profiles:** User profiles are created as standardized JSON resumes hosted on IPFS, giving users control over their data.
*   **Staked Connections:** Users can stake FIL tokens to strengthen their connections, acting as a verifiable endorsement.
*   **Referral Tokenomics:** Introductions within the network are facilitated through a fee-based referral system.
*   **DAO Governance:** A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governs the network, managing fees, investments, and rewards using staked connection tokens for voting.
*   **FEVM Marketplace:** Utilizes the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM) marketplace for managing profile data hosting on IPFS.

### Technologies Used:

*   FEVM (Filecoin EVM)
*   IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
*   Solidity (Smart Contracts)
*   TypeScript (Frontend)
