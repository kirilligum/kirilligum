## Project Summary

Trust-and-Teach AI DApp is a proof-of-concept project demonstrating Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) in a decentralized manner, leveraging blockchain technology.

### Key Features:

*   **On-chain RLHF:** Implements Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback directly on the blockchain.
*   **Decentralized LLM Inference:** Runs Large Language Model (LLM) inference within an optimistic roll-up using Cartesi VM.
*   **Transparency and Trust:** Leverages on-chain trust, scalability, and transparency for AI alignment.
*   **Dataset Generation:** Creates a dataset of human rankings of LLM responses, used for RLHF fine-tuning.

### Motivation:

To create trusted, specialized, and aligned LLMs by running the RLHF process on-chain, leveraging the security and decentralization of Ethereum and Cartesi rollups.

### How it Works:

The LLM inference runs inside a Cartesi optimistic rollup, enabling execution of Linux applications on the EVM. Users can generate LLM responses, rank them on-chain, and contribute to a transparent and auditable RLHF dataset.
