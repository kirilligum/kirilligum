## Project Summary

AI Data Peer Review is a Web3 peer-review system designed to ensure the creation of high-quality datasets for training AI models. Inspired by scientific publishing, this project leverages blockchain for transparency and trust in AI data creation. Built for the Lightlink Hackathon.

### Key Features:

*   **Decentralized Peer Review:** Implements a peer-review process on the blockchain for AI datasets.
*   **Expert Reviewer Matching:** Matches reviewers to data submissions based on keyword expertise and shuffles reviewers using API3 QRNG to avoid bias.
*   **Blind Voting:** Utilizes a commit-reveal scheme for blind voting by reviewers, ensuring unbiased evaluations.
*   **On-chain Transparency:** Stores all data and review processes on-chain for transparency and auditability.
*   **Incentivized Data Creation:** Provides a framework for compensating authors and reviewers, fostering a decentralized economy for high-quality AI data labeling.

### Technologies Used:

*   Lightlink Enterprise Mode: For gasless transactions and scalability.
*   API3 QRNG: For quantum random number generation to shuffle reviewers.
*   Solidity: For smart contract development.
*   Remix and Forge: For development and testing environment.
